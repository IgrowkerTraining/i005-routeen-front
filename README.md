# ðŸ“± Routeen

**Routeen** is a _SportTech_ app designed for trainers and athletes who want to manage workout routines in a digital, fast, and intuitive way.

It allows trainers to create and assign personalized plans for each athlete, including exercises, reps, weights, and rest times. Athletes can access their routines from any device using a unique OTP code, eliminating the need for spreadsheets or external apps.

The platform also lets athletes update their progress in real time (modify weights, mark completed exercises, etc.), and trainers receive automatic notifications to adjust routines based on performance.

A control panel for trainers is included, where they can manage athletes, routines, and quickly access training history.
